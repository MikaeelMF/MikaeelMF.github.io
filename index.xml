      <description>&amp;ldquo;An introduction to bitcoin and blockchain: A computer science and economical approach (Based on Iran financial crisis)&amp;rdquo; is my BSc project. In this work, I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed bitcoin from both an economic and technical perspective. The first section shows why bitcoin can be used as a valuable commodity especially in countries dealing with financial problems. After that, It reviews some important parts of blockchain technology for whoever wants to start learning the technical aspect of it.</description>
